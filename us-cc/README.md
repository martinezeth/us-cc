## Project Overview
The US Crisis Coordination (USCC) project aims to deliver a web-based platform that empowers communities and local authorities to respond quickly to disasters. It facilitates the reporting of incidents, management of resources, coordination of volunteer efforts, and utilization of real-time data for informed decision-making. The primary goal is to enable users within communities to report, confirm, converse about, and share information regarding weather anomalies and disaster response resources before losing internet connectivity.
